## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- React - JS library
- Flexbox - CSS layout
- Sass - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

During this project, I got more familiar with a creating routing for pages. Responsivity is a key part of a website, and it's important to make sure that the pages are responsive to the user's device. This was one of the bigger projects I undertook, and I learned a lot about how to create a responsive website

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan on taking larger projects, that require thinking in advance about the layout and design of the website. I feel like I didn't use SASS to its fullest, but I'll be sure to practice it to reach the full potential of it.

### Useful resources

- [Dynamic image importing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53775936/import-image-dynamically-in-react-component) - This helped me to get each image to load dynamically. I used this to load the planets, crew, and technology images.
