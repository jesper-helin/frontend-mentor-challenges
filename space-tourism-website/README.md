## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- ~~View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size~~
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- React - JS library
- Flexbox - CSS layout
- Sass - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

During this project, I got more familiar with a creating routing for pages. I learned the importance of going **mobile** first, and adding to the page after that, rather than the other way around. That's solely the reason why this page is optimized for desktop. 

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan on taking larger projects, that require thinking in advance about the layout and design of the website. I'm going to start working first on smaller screen sizes, and only after that will I move on to bigger screen sizes. I feel like I didn't use SASS to its fullest, but I'll be sure to practice it to reach the full potential of it.

### Useful resources

- [Dynamic image importing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53775936/import-image-dynamically-in-react-component) - This helped me to get each image to load dynamically. I used this to load the planets, crew, and technology images.
