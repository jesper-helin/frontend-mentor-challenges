## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- React - JS library
- Flexbox - CSS layout
- Sass - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

During this project, I got more familiar with a creating routing for pages. I learned the importance of going **mobile** first, and adding to the page after that, rather than the other way around. That's solely the reason why this page is optimized for desktop. 

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan on taking larger projects, that require thinking in advance about the layout and design of the website. I'm going to start working first on smaller screen sizes, and only after that will I move on to bigger screen sizes. I feel like I didn't use SASS to its fullest, but I'll be sure to practice it to reach the full potential of it.

### Useful resources

- [Dynamic image importing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53775936/import-image-dynamically-in-react-component) - This helped me to get each image to load dynamically. I used this to load the planets, crew, and technology images.
